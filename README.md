The STM32 microcontroller general-purpose input/output pin (GPIO) provides many ways to
interface with external circuits within an application framework. This application note
provides basic information about GPIO configurations as well as guidelines for hardware
and software developers to optimize the power performance of their STM32 32-bit Arm®
Cortex® MCUs using the GPIO pin.
